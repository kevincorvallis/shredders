- Mt. Hood Meadows (1 webcam)
- Timberline (1 webcam)

### Mountains Using Dynamic Webcams
⚠️ **Require Dynamic Loading**:

- Bluewood (generator-dependent)

### Road Webcam Systems

**Washington (WSDOT)**:
- Access: https://wsdot.com/travel/real-time/cameras
- Passes: I-90, US-2, SR-542, US-12, SR-410

**Oregon (ODOT TripCheck)**:
- Access: https://tripcheck.com
- Highways: US-26, OR-58, US-20, Century Drive

**Idaho (ITD)**:
- Limited cameras for ski resort access

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update mountains.ts** with additional webcam URLs where static images are available
2. **Add road webcam references** as a new optional field in MountainConfig
3. **Consider webcam type field** to handle dynamic vs static webcams differently
4. **Test all static URLs** to verify they're working and updating regularly
5. **Add webcam viewer component** that can handle both static images and dynamic feeds

---

## Technical Notes

- Most resort webcams update every 10 minutes
- Static image URLs are preferred for simple display
- Dynamic webcams (Roundshot, live streams) require special viewers
- Road webcams are critical for trip planning (check conditions before driving)
- Some webcams go offline during off-season or when generators are off
- WSDOT/ODOT cameras typically show still images with timestamps
