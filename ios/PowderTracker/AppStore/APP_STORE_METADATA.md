## Review Notes for Apple

```
Test Account (if needed):
Email: contact@pookieb.com
Password: [Create test account before submission]

The app requires location permission to show nearby mountains, but functions fully without it by letting users browse all resorts manually.

Weather data comes from public government APIs (NOAA, SNOTEL) and free weather services (Open-Meteo, RainViewer).

Apple Sign In is the primary authentication method.
